DISCORD STEAM BOT 

How do I run this ðŸ¤” ?

Suppose if you're willing to grab the source code and run it. You're required two things. 
>> 1. A discord bot that you can create from these instructions : https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html
>> 2. A steam API key that can be obtained from: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CSGo/vignettes/auth.html

These two will generate the values required inside of the env file. 

Upon running the code, your discord bot should initiate the command "!info" and it'll be yours to use !

Note: 

!steamUser may not always work not necessarily because the user does not exist, but steam has a hard time finding users purely through usernames. Rather, it's more effective using steamID's which can be found by going to a steam profile, right-clicking their profile page and copying their page URL. 
It will be in the following format:
>> https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/steamID/
